      <p>  A composer may often come up with a short phrase or 'idea' and not develop it. They may throw it away or forget about it due to lack of interest, inspiration or time. Maybe they won't even record the 'idea'. The potential of that 'idea', is then no more.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="col">
      <p>To solve this problem we decided to create a platform for composers to upload their unfinished ideas, with the intention of other composers being able to contibute to that 'idea' and result in a colaborative composition.</p>
