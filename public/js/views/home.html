      <p>  A composer may often come up with a short phrase or 'idea' and not develop it. They may throw it away or forget about it due to lack of interest, inspiration or time. Maybe they won't even record the 'idea'. The potential of that 'idea', is then no more.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="col">
      <p>To solve this problem we decided to create a platform for composers to upload their unfinished ideas, with the intention of other composers being able to contibute to that 'idea' and result in a colaborative composition.</p>
    </div>

<div class="row2">

    <div class="col1"> <p></p>  James is a composer, he uploads an 'idea'. (e.g Piano Motif - 30 seconds)</div>

    <div class="col1">Another composer Lauren listens to James' 'idea' and feels inspired.</div>

    <div class="col1">Lauren adds an 'addition' (another single instrument track - e.g violin) to the 'idea'.</div>

    <div class="col1">The process continues resulting in a beautiful and collabrative composition.</div>
